\section{Question 1 Solution}
Input/output relation: \(y_1(t)= x(t)cos(2 \pi f_0 t) \)
\\ Properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory:} The system is memoryless since the output is only depend on the current t value.
    \item \textbf{Linearity:} The system is linear it can be shown as follows: \begin{equation}\begin{split}
        \underline{input} &\Rightarrow \underline{output} \\
        x_1(t)  & \Rightarrow x_1(t) cos(2\pi f_0 t) \\
        a x_2(t) & \Rightarrow  a x_2(t) cos(2\pi f_0 t) \\
        x_1(t) +  a x_2(t)  &\Rightarrow x_1(t) cos(2\pi f_0 t) + a x_2(t) cos(2\pi f_0 t)      \end{split}
    \end{equation} 
    So the linearity holds.
    \item \textbf{Causality:} Since the system is memoryless it can be said that the system is causal.
    \item \textbf{Time-Invariance:} The system is time-varying since a time shift in the input does not result in same time shift in the output. \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            Let x_2(t) &= x_1(t-t_0) \\
            y_1(t) &= x_1(t) cos(2 \pi f_0 t) \\ 
            y_2(t) &= x_2(t) cos(2 \pi f_0 t)\\
            y_1(t-t_0) &=    x_1(t-t_0) cos(2 \pi f_0 (t-t_0))\\
            \text{However  } y_2(t) & \neq y_1(t-t_0)
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Stability:} Since \(-1 \leq cos(alpha) \leq 1\) if the x(t) is bounded the y(t) is bounded as well. So the system is stable.
\end{itemize}
Input/output relation: \(y_2(t)= c_1 x(t) + c_2 x^2(t) \)
\\ Properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory:} The system is memoryless since the output is only depend on the current t value.
    \item \textbf{Linearity:}The system is non-linear and it can be shown as follows: \begin{equation}\begin{split}
        \underline{input} &\Rightarrow \underline{output} \\
        x_1(t)  & \Rightarrow c_1 x_1(t) + c_2 x_1^2(t) \\
        a x_2(t) & \Rightarrow  c_1 a x_2(t) + a^2 c_2 x_2^2(t) \\
        x_1(t) +  a x_2(t)  & \not\Rightarrow   c_1 (x_1(t) + a x_2(t)) + c_2 (x_1^2(t) + a^2 x_2^2(t) )
          \end{split}
    \end{equation} 
    \item \textbf{Causality:} Since the system is memoryless it can be said that the system is causal.
    \item \textbf{Time-Invariance:} The system is time invariant and it can be shown as follows;
    \item \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \text{Let } x_2(t) &= x_1(t-t_0) \\
            y_1(t) &= c_1 x_1(t) + c_2 x_1^2(t) \\ 
            y_2(t) &= x_2(t) + c_2 x_2^2(t) \\
            y_1(t-t_0) &=    c_1 x_1(t-t_0) + c_2 x_1^2(t-t_0) \\
            \text{Then  } y_2(t) &= y_1(t-t_0)
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Stability:} System is stable, that is if the input of \(x(t)\) is bounded output is also bounded.
\end{itemize}


Input/output relation: \(y_3(t)= x(t)+4 \)
\\ Properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory:} The system is memoryless since it just shifts the input signal.
    \item \textbf{Linearity:} Let  \(x(t)\) be equal to 0. The output is not equal to the 0. So the system is not linear.
    \item \textbf{Causality:} Since the system is memoryless it is causal.
    \item \textbf{Time-Invariance:} Any time shift on the input signal results in same amount of time shift on the output signal. So the system is time invariant.
    \item \textbf{Stability:} The system is stable, as the output is just the time shifted version of the input. 
\end{itemize}

Input/output relation: \(y_4(t)= x(t/3) \)
\\ Properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory:}  The system is with memory since it squeezes the input signal.
    \item \textbf{Linearity:} The system is linear.
    \item \textbf{Causality:} Since the output may depend on different time instant other than the current t the system is not causal.
    \item \textbf{Time-Invariance:} As the input signal is squeezed the time shift in the input may not result in same amount of shift in the output.
    \item \textbf{Stability:} The system is stable as the magnitude stays for this system always.
\end{itemize}

Input/output relation: \(y_5(t)= t x(t+5) \)
\\ Properties:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory:} The system is with memory because of the t+5 term.
    \item \textbf{Linearity:} The system is linear because the result stays linear if we multiply the input with a constant and sum it with another input. 
    \item \textbf{Causality:} The system is not causal because of the fact that the value of the input at t+5 time instant is used.
    \item \textbf{Time-Invariance:} The system is time-varying. The reason can be expressed as follows: \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
             x_2(t+5) &= x_1(t+t_0+5) \\
             y_2(t) &\neq y_1(t) 
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Stability:} System is not stable consider the case where time is at infinity.
\end{itemize}

Input/output relation: \(y_6(t)= u(x(t)) \)
\\ Properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory:} System is memoryless since the output depend only on the current input.
    \item \textbf{Linearity:} The system is not linear. Consider the case \(t = 0^- \and t = 0^+\)
    \item \textbf{Causality:} Memoylessness implies the system is causal.
    \item \textbf{Time-Invariance:} The system is time invariant. The shift in input leads same amount of shift in output.
    \item \textbf{Stability:} The system is stable. The outputs are bounded as long as inputs are bounded.
\end{itemize}



\section{Question 2 Solution}
\subsection{a)}
To be able to find the output signals the input signals are convolved with the inputs. The outputs are obtained with the computations given below;
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        h(t) \ast 1 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \alpha^{\tau-t} u(\tau-t)  \,d\tau  
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{ii)}
\section{Question 5 Solution}
\subsection{a)}
In part 5, we convolved the input signal \(x[n] = sin(\frac{2\pi n}{7} )\) and impulse response \(h[n] = u[n] - u[n-L]\) to find output signal \(y[n]\) in MATLAB.
\subsubsection{i)}
In this part N(signal length) was equal to 20. Then following signal was plotted.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{i.png}
    \caption{Signal x[n]}
    \end{figure} 
    
\subsubsection{ii)}
Impulse response \(h[n]\) was created with amplitude 1 and pulse duration L. L was equal to 14 in this example.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{i2.png}
    \caption{Impulse Response}
    \end{figure} 
    
\subsubsection{iii)}
In this part we implemented convolution operation. Since our signals are not infinity we used zero padding to be able to compute convolution. Then we obtained \(y[n]\) using for loop. Since zero padding leads to mistake on last a few values, we only plotted correct ones. Following plot shows the output of convolution operation with padding.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{convwithpadding.png}
    \caption{Convolution with Padding}
    \end{figure} 
    
\subsubsection{iv)}
Convolution operation executed in last part can be done by conv method in MATLAB. Following graph shows the convolution results. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{i4.png}
    \caption{Convolution Operation Using conv Method}
    \end{figure} 
    As indicated in figures in section iii and iv , the convolution method in MATLAB results in more acquarete results. Due to the zero padding method in part iii, results after n>N are nor correct.


\subsection{b)}
To observe pulse duration length(L) effect on output signal, random signal input convolved with \(h[n]\) by changing L in the \(h[n] = u[n] - u[n-L]\). L was chossen to be 2 , 15 and 25.
Following graph shows the random signal \(x[n]\).
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{b_signal.png}
    \caption{Random Signal}
    \end{figure} 


The convolution result \(y[n] = x[n] * h[n]\) with L = 2 is shown in following figure.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{b_duration2.png}
    \caption{Convolution Result with L=2}
    \end{figure} 


    The convolution result \(y[n] = x[n] * h[n]\) with L = 15 is shown in following figure.
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{b_duration15.png}
        \caption{Convolution Result with L=15}
        \end{figure} 

        
        The convolution result \(y[n] = x[n] * h[n]\) with L = 25 is shown in following figure. 
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{b_duration25.png}
            \caption{Convolution Result with L=25}
            \end{figure} 



As shown in al figures, the smoothness of graph increases as L increases. Although it gets smoother, these systems called "averaging filter" ,may lead to some loses. This filter can be used to observe a signal's trend and obtain meaningfull data.
